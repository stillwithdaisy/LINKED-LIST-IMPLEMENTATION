## Efficient Linked List Implementation in C 
This project focuses on the efficient implementation of a singly linked list in the C programming language, which is a fundamental data structure widely used in computer science for dynamic memory management and flexible data manipulation. The core objective of the project is to understand and demonstrate essential operations on a singly linked list—insertion, deletion, and traversal—through a modular and performance-oriented coding approach.

The entire development process was carried out using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a lightweight yet powerful source code editor. To support C programming and create a smooth workflow, I utilized the C/C++ extension by Microsoft for code intelligence, syntax highlighting, and debugging. For compiling and executing the code efficiently, I used the Code Runner extension, which provided a one-click solution to run the program directly within the terminal.

A singly linked list is a collection of nodes where each node contains a data element and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists offer dynamic memory allocation and can grow or shrink at runtime without needing contiguous memory.

Key Features and Functionalities Implemented:
Node Structure Definition
I created a struct Node that contains two components: an int data field and a struct Node* next pointer. This forms the basic building block of the list.

Insertion Operations
The project includes functions to insert a node at the beginning, at the end, and at a specific position in the list. These functions use pointer manipulation to ensure efficient memory usage and quick execution, especially for insertions at the head and tail.

Deletion Operations
Deletion functions were implemented to remove nodes from the beginning, end, and by value. The logic ensures proper memory deallocation using free() to prevent memory leaks.

Traversal Operation
A traversal function was created to iterate through the list and display each node’s value. This helped in verifying the correctness of insertion and deletion operations.

User-Friendly Menu
A basic command-line interface using a menu-driven approach was integrated to allow users to interactively perform operations like insert, delete, and view. This not only improved usability but also simulated a real-world application of linked lists.

Development Environment:
The project was entirely coded in C using Visual Studio Code. With the C/C++ extension, I benefited from real-time error checking and smart code completion. The Code Runner extension made it simple to compile and run the program without switching terminals or writing manual commands. This setup significantly enhanced development speed and accuracy.

Conclusion:
This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of dynamic data structures and pointer operations in C. By implementing the linked list from scratch and optimizing memory usage, I learned how data structures behave at a low level. Moreover, working in Visual Studio Code with modern extensions provided a professional development experience. The techniques and practices learned through this project are directly applicable to building more complex systems involving dynamic data manipulation.
